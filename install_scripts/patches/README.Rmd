# Resolved Issues

## Patch 1.1 - 1/23/15

### Identified Issues
We recently released a patch to address four issues: 

1. Lack of SSH support for `rstudio`
2. Lack of `UIUC_IMAGE_VERSION` variable.
3. Environmental variables not being accessible by children of the current process.
4. Removal of installation script and patch scripts.  

### Affected Version
These issues only affect users on `UIUC_IMAGE_VERSION='STAT490 Image Version: 1.0'`. 
To tell if you are on this image, type into shell:

```{r uiuc_image_version, engine='bash'}
echo $UIUC_IMAGE_VERSION
```

If the returned value is blank, you are on `STAT490 Image Version: 1.0`.

If the returned value is equal to `STAT490 Image Version: 1.1`, then you have already applied the patch

If the returned value is greater than `STAT490 Image Version: 1.1`, then you are living in the future and should share with me the future code that I will write.

### Applying the Patch

To apply the patch, login as root and run:
```{r bash_patch, engine='bash'}
# Obtain Script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coatless/stat490uiuc/master/install_scripts/patches/patch1_1.sh
# Set run permissions
